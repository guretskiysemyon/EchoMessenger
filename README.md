# Echo Messenger


About the project:
In this project, we created a messenger application similar to WhatsApp or Telegram. The project includes three main parts: the client-side web application, server-side, and Android application. I will explain the general structure and technologies that we used and provide links to the corresponding repositories.

In the first part, we developed the client-side using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the React library.
